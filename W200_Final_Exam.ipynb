For example, numerical fields should fall within realistic limits, and categorical variables should contain valid categories.\n",

In practical scenarios, this can lead to poor decision-making, resource misallocation, and reduced credibility of the analysis.

    "## 4: Clinical disease data (40 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your boss comes to you Monday morning and says “I figured out our next step; we are going to pivot from an online craft store and become a data center for genetic disease information! I found **ClinVar** which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gene name\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutation ID number\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Mutation value (reference & alternate bases)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Clinical significance (CLNSIG)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Disease that is implicated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The deliverables are the final result as a dataframe with a short discussion of any specifics. (that is, what data you would present to your boss with the explanation of your results)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use the instructor-modified \"clinvar_final.txt\" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing This file was modified to be not exactly the same as 'standard' .vcf file to test your data parsing skills. **This is a large file so do NOT upload it into your github repo!**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Replace missing values in the dataframe with: 'Not_Given'. Print or display this (including the Not_Given count) for the column `CLNSIG` by using pandas value_counts() function (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) State in your answer how you define harmful mutations\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Do your best on getting to above requirements and submit whatever you do before the deadline. If your work is incomplete be sure to describe the blockers that got in your way and how you might get past them (if given more time).**\n",
    "\n",
    "7) You can use as many code blocks as you need. Please clean-up your code and make it readable for the graders!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints** \n",
    "* We do not expect you to have any medical knowledge to solve this problem; look at the data, read the documentation provided, and write down your assumptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct pseudocode will give you partial credit so start with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Map out which fields you want to extract: Are they in the same place every time? What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas and NumPy parsers correctly recognize the end of each line in in the ClinVar file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work. You can answer the question with the information provided below or using the (partial) data dictionary file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lx9yHdlcqmU_OlHiTUXKC_LQDqYBypH_/view?usp=sharing. Our goal is to see that you can put together a sensible plan, implement a solid parsing strategy, and document and justify the decisions that you made."

    "4) Please Write your assumptions here: \n",
    "\n",
    "Harmful mutations were defined as those classified as 'Pathogenic' in the CLNSIG (Clinical Significance) field. This classification was assumed to be a reliable indicator of harmfulness based on the data provided. Missing values in critical columns such as CLNSIG, GENEINFO, and CLNDN were replaced with 'Not_Given', and only rows with valid CLNSIG values of 'Pathogenic' were included in the analysis. Rows with missing GENEINFO (Gene Name) were still included, as these mutations could still be relevant and harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output was intentionally limited to the first 100 harmful mutations to meet the requirements. Parsing of the INFO column was based on the observation that key-value pairs are separated by = and delimited by ;. Finally, the CLNDN (Disease) field was interpreted as listing diseases associated with mutations. Missing values in this field were noted but did not exclude a mutation from being classified as harmful."

    "The analysis identified 100 harmful mutations in the dataset, which are included in the final result. All rows in the filtered dataset had valid CLNSIG values, with no missing entries in this field. These mutations spanned multiple genes, including ISG15, AGRN, ESPN, and PLEKHG5. Diseases associated with these mutations include immunodeficiencies, congenital syndromes, deafness, and spinal muscular atrophy, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final results were presented as a DataFrame containing the following columns: Gene Name, Mutation ID, Mutation Position, Reference Base, Alternate Base, Clinical Significance, and Disease. For example, mutations such as 1014143 in the gene ISG15 were linked to immunodeficiencies, while mutations in the gene AGRN were associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes. These findings highlight the potential significance of the dataset for research and clinical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset demonstrates a range of harmful mutations associated with severe genetic disorders, emphasizing its potential value in identifying disease-causing mutations. However, some entries had missing GENEINFO fields, indicating incomplete data that may require further curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the utility of the dataset, deeper analysis should be conducted to include all harmful mutations beyond the first 100 rows. Trends across different genes, diseases, and mutation types should be assessed. Additionally, efforts should focus on curating and enriching the dataset, particularly addressing rows with missing GENEINFO or CLNDN values. Finally, integrating this dataset with other genetic or clinical datasets could provide further insights and broaden its applicability for research and commercial purposes."
